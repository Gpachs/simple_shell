Description

A simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX Africa Software Engineering.

Installation

Clone this repository into your working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags:

-Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89

Usage
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

Interactive Mode

In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

Non-Interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

echo "ls" | ./shell

All code was written by Goldman Obioma and Hellen Namatovu
